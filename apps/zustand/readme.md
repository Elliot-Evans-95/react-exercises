# Zustand

## Overview
The most popular state management library in react is Zustand, this has overtaken redux in terms of popularity and usage.
Its ease of use to get and set values enables developers to share state between components easily.

## The Problem
Currently the app is using state in the top level components and uses callbacks to pass data back up. Could this be changed to use Zustand?
